## Explaining the Origin of Cosmic Acceleration with WFIRST

Cosmic acceleration is the most surprising cosmological discovery in many decades. Even the least exotic explanation of this phenomenon requires an energetically dominant component of the universe with properties never previously seen in nature, pervading otherwise empty space, with an energy density that is many orders of magnitude higher than naive expectations. Testing and distinguishing among possible explanations requires cosmological measurements of extremely high precision that probe the full history of cosmic expansion and structure growth. This program is one of the defining objectives of the Wide-Field Infrared Survey Telescope ([WFIRST](https://wfirst.gsfc.nasa.gov)).

The WFIRST mission, as described in past Science Definition Team (SDT) reports ([Spergel et al. 2013a](https://arxiv.org/abs/1305.5422), [Spergel et al. 2013b](https://arxiv.org/abs/1305.5425), [Spergel et al. 2015](https://arxiv.org/abs/1503.03757)), has the ability to improve these measurements by 1-2 orders of magnitude compared to the current state of the art, while simultaneously extending their redshift grasp, greatly improving control of systematic effects, and taking a unified approach to multiple probes that provide complementary physical information and cross-checks of cosmological results.

## Science Investigation Team

We have assembled a team with the expertise and commitment needed to address the stringent challenges of the WFIRST dark energy program through the Project’s formulation phase. The imaging and spectroscopic elements of the High Latitude Survey (HLS) will be realized as an integrated observing program, and they jointly impose requirements on instrument and telescope performance, operations, and data transfer. The methods for simulating and interpreting weak lensing and galaxy clustering observations largely overlap, and many members of our team have expertise in both areas.
