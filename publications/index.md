## FIRST WFIRST [OIII] Emission Line Galaxy Mock Catalog

### [WFIRST [OIII] emitters mock catalog](https://sites.google.com/site/catalogswfirst/)

We created the first WFIRST [O III] mock galaxy catalog from a light cone simulation generated by the group of Risa Wechsler at Stanford. The simulation contains about 3 billion galaxies over 10,313 sq. degrees and up to redshift 2.3. Each galaxy contains its own spectral energy distribution which is generated to fit the most updated luminosity function and color evolution measurements. Starting from the simulation, the mock catalog has been created by selecting [O III] emitters with [O III] flux above WFIRST detection limit, which has been set to 6.5 sigma sensitivity at 6 exposure depth. The catalog contains galaxies in the redshift range 1 to 2.3, with a number density and redshift distribution that mimic the ones forecast for the WFIRST.
