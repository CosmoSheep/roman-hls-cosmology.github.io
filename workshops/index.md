# Community Workshops

***

Our Science Investigation Team will host frequent community workshops with the goals of building awareness of and broad support for the WFIRST dark energy program and inspiring the community to develop methods and carry out investigations that will maximize the cosmologicaly members of our team have expertise in both areas. Please email Olivier Dor√© if you have suggestions and would like to be involved.


### Enabling Cosmological Resonances Between WFIRST and LSST, September 13, 2016 - September 15, 2016 at the KISS Center

This science-focused workshop will explore the scientific synergies between LSST and WFIRST, with a focus on cosmology. It is jointly organized by the WFIRST HLS Cosmology Science Investigation Team (SIT) and the LSST Dark Energy Science Collaboration (DESC). Presentations and agenda are available [here](https://conference.ipac.caltech.edu/wfirst_lsst/).
