# Community Workshops

***

Our Science Investigation Team will host frequent community workshops with the goals of building awareness of and broad support for the WFIRST dark energy program and inspiring the community to develop methods and carry out investigations that will maximize the cosmological return from WFIRST. We will gather this way expertise and perspective distinct from our own. Please email Olivier Doré if you have suggestions and would like to be involved.

## Second Community Workshop: **Exploiting Extra-galactic Synergies between WFIRST and Future Facilities**, *02/27-03/01, Pasadena, CA*

#### Goal

This workshop will focus on synergies between the unprecedented survey speed of WFIRST in the near-infrared and other contemporary and future multi-wavelength facilities for extra-galactic science and cosmology. The goal is to guide planning of the 2000 sq. deg. High-Latitude Survey (HLS) and the Supernova survey to maximize synergies with other facilities.  We will also explore how future facilities could enhance and enable science with WFIRST and guide the design of WFIRST to enable new science.

Surveys of particular focus will include LSST, Euclid, Spitzer, JWST, HSC/PFS, SKA and ngVLA, CMB S4, eROSITA.

*Peter Capak, Olivier Doré*

#### Registration

The workshop will be limited to 60 participants and is by invitation only. Please contact the organizers if you are interested in attending.
