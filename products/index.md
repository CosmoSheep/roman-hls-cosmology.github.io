### Cosmological parameters forecast chains

Please find below some chains corresponding to the forecast for the current survey of the WFIRST High Latitude Survey, combining weak-gravitational lensing (WL), cluster count (CC) and redshift space distortions (GRS). These chains were computed using the CosmoLike software (Krause & Eifler 2016)[https://arxiv.org/abs/1601.05779]
